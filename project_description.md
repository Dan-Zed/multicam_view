- running it lightweight, on raspberry pi 5 linux 
    -- so far the copied project is running fine also with system dependencies not listed in the poetry env
- live stream four cameras at once for preview
    -- stream is in large format on the webgui
- have each camera stream individually, not together, this means switching between each at a low frame rate and low resolution
- have a red cross in the center of each view
- capture an image from each at high resolution when the user clicks capture
- preview of captured image is a combined image, 2x2 from each camera
