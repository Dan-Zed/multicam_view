# MultiCam View Troubleshooting Progress - 2025-04-07

## Issues Addressed

During this session, we focused on troubleshooting several issues related to testing and image capture functionality in the MultiCam View application.

### Testing Issues

1. **Test Execution Conflicts**
   - Identified that the test failures were due to the application already running and holding exclusive access to the camera hardware
   - Modified the `CameraManager` class to support a `test_mode` parameter that avoids accessing real hardware during tests
   - Updated test files to use `test_mode=True` to enable proper testing without hardware conflicts

2. **Thread-Related Issues**
   - Enhanced thread management in the `CameraManager` class
   - Improved error handling and cleanup in background threads
   - Added safeguards against race conditions in the camera cycling functionality
   - Fixed logging-related issues with thread termination

3. **Test Framework Improvements**
   - Added an auto-cleanup fixture to ensure all `CameraManager` instances are properly cleaned up after tests
   - Implemented better mocking approaches for hardware components
   - Created a specialized test script that runs tests sequentially to avoid resource conflicts

### Capture Functionality Issues

1. **Script Improvements**
   - Fixed `start.sh` and `stop.sh` scripts to correctly detect the running Python process
   - Updated process detection from `python3 run.py` to `python run.py` to match what Poetry actually runs

2. **Debugging Tools**
   - Created a comprehensive debug interface at `/debug` with real-time logging
   - Added a debug test page for the AJAX functionality at `/debug/javascript_ajax_test`
   - Implemented step-by-step debugging endpoints for the capture pipeline
   - Added detailed error reporting for each step of the capture process

3. **Error Handling Enhancements**
   - Improved error handling throughout the application
   - Added better exception handling with detailed logging
   - Created specialized debug endpoints for testing each part of the capture workflow:
     - `/debug/captures` - Shows capture directory information
     - `/debug/test_capture` - Tests single camera capture
     - `/debug/test_capture_pipeline` - Tests the entire capture pipeline step by step

## Implementation Approach

1. **Test Mode Implementation**
   - Added a `test_mode` parameter to the `CameraManager` class
   - Implemented conditional hardware access based on test mode
   - Created mock implementations of hardware functionality for testing

2. **Thread Safety Improvements**
   - Enhanced thread management with proper joining and cleanup
   - Improved error handling in threaded operations
   - Added safeguards against race conditions using local variables

3. **Debugging Interface**
   - Created a debug version of the main UI with comprehensive logging
   - Added detailed error reporting for the capture process
   - Implemented JavaScript-based tests for event handling issues

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Capture Functionality**
   - Use the debug interface to pinpoint where the capture process is failing
   - Check for permission issues with the capture directory
   - Verify image saving functionality works correctly

2. **Test JavaScript Event Handling**
   - Verify that the capture button events are firing correctly
   - Check for issues with AJAX response handling

3. **Further Stability Improvements**
   - Implement additional error recovery mechanisms
   - Add more user feedback during the capture process
   - Consider adding a health check system for the camera hardware
