# MultiCam View - Stream Update (April 7, 2025)

## Summary of Changes

We've made several significant improvements to the MultiCam View application to enhance both the user experience and the image quality:

### 1. Preview Resolution Upgrade
- Increased the preview resolution from 640x480 to 1280x720 (720p)
- Updated the aspect ratio in the UI from 4:3 to 16:9 to match the new resolution
- Adjusted stream container dimensions to properly display the higher resolution feed

### 2. UI Layout Improvements
- Changed the layout from side-by-side grid to a stacked vertical arrangement
- Made the preview pane full width for better visibility
- Placed the captured composite 2x2 image below the preview
- Improved responsive design for better display on different screen sizes

### 3. Autofocus Implementation
- Added autofocus capability to both video and still image modes
- Configured continuous autofocus for the video preview
- Set one-time autofocus for still image captures
- Increased stabilization delay to give autofocus time to work before capturing

### 4. Four-in-One Mode for Preview
- Replaced camera cycling with the multiplexer's four-in-one mode
- Updated UI to reflect the new mode with appropriate icons and text
- Implemented toggle between four-in-one preview and single camera view
- Maintained individual camera selection for high-resolution captures

## Technical Details

### Preview Resolution
We modified the video configuration to use 1280x720 resolution:
```python
self.video_config = self.picam.create_video_configuration(
    main={"size": (1280, 720)},  # 720p for better preview quality
    controls={"AfMode": controls.AfModeEnum.Continuous}  # Enable continuous autofocus
)
```

### Autofocus Configuration
Autofocus settings were added directly to the camera configurations:
```python
# For video mode (continuous autofocus)
controls={"AfMode": controls.AfModeEnum.Continuous}

# For still capture (one-time autofocus)
controls={"AfMode": controls.AfModeEnum.Auto}
```

### Four-in-One Mode Implementation
The camera cycling functionality was replaced with a simpler toggle between four-in-one and single camera modes:
```python
# Set to four-in-one mode (default)
self.select_camera('all')  # Uses command 0x00 via I2C multiplexer
```

## User Interface Changes
- Updated button text and icons to indicate the current mode
- Changed informational text to explain that all cameras are shown in four-in-one mode
- Improved state management for camera selection buttons

## Next Steps
- Monitor autofocus performance in different lighting conditions
- Consider further UI refinements based on user feedback
- Explore additional settings for optimizing image quality
