# Multicam View Implementation Progress - 2025-04-07

## Implemented Features

1. **Camera Manager**
   - Created a dedicated `CameraManager` class to handle camera multiplexer control
   - Implemented I2C control using `smbus2` to switch between cameras
   - Added functions for cycling through cameras, capturing images, and creating grid views
   - Built in error handling and recovery mechanisms

2. **Web Application**
   - Updated Flask app to handle multicamera functionality
   - Added routes for camera selection, cycling control, and capture
   - Implemented file storage for individual and combined camera images
   - Added debugging endpoints to help troubleshoot issues

3. **User Interface**
   - Enhanced UI to show active camera indicator
   - Added camera selection controls
   - Implemented automatic camera cycling
   - Modified capture workflow to handle multiple cameras

4. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Created comprehensive test suite using pytest
   - Implemented mock-based testing for hardware components
   - Added test runner and coverage reporting
   - Created debugging endpoints and tools

## Implementation Approach

1. **Starting Point**
   - Began with an existing Pi Camera streaming application
   - Analyzed core components that needed modification

2. **Modular Design**
   - Separated camera management logic from web application
   - Created clean API boundary between components
   - Used object-oriented design for extensibility

3. **Handling Hardware Constraints**
   - Implemented special handling for the broken camera (index 3)
   - Added failsafe mechanisms for switching issues
   - Built proper cleanup and resource management

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Created mock-based unit tests to verify functionality without hardware
   - Built integration tests for Flask routes
   - Implemented debugging tools to diagnose issues in the field

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Camera Identification and Control**
   - Working with camera multiplexer required precise I2C command timing
   - Implemented delays between camera switching to avoid instability
   - Added special handling for the broken camera

2. **Image Format Compatibility**
   - Discovered RGBA/JPEG conversion issues causing capture failures
   - Added explicit format conversion to ensure compatibility
   - Implemented proper error handling for format conversion

3. **File System Issues**
   - Encountered problems with file permissions for captured images
   - Added explicit permission setting for directories and files
   - Used absolute paths to avoid working directory issues

4. **Stream Continuity**
   - Had to balance camera switching with stream stability
   - Implemented threading with proper locks to prevent race conditions
   - Added error recovery to restart streaming after failures

5. **Cross-Platform Development**
   - Development on macOS with deployment on Raspberry Pi Linux
   - Created platform-agnostic code where possible
   - Implemented proper error handling for platform-specific issues

## Current Issues

1. **Image Capture Workflow**
   - Capture functionality seems to fail silently in the web interface
   - Added debug endpoints to check file system and capture process
   - Test captures work via direct API calls but not from UI
   - Need to investigate possible race conditions or browser issues

2. **Camera Performance**
   - Camera switching introduces latency in the stream
   - Need to optimize frame rate and resolution for better performance
   - Consider buffering frames to reduce perceived latency

3. **Grid Image Rendering**
   - The combined 2x2 grid sometimes fails to render correctly
   - Added logging for each step of the grid creation process
   - May need to adjust image scaling or formatting

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Capture Workflow**
   - Run tests to isolate capture issue
   - Add more detailed logging in capture process
   - Verify browser-side JavaScript handling of capture response

2. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Add more robust recovery mechanisms
   - Implement better user feedback for hardware issues
   - Consider adding a health check system

3. **Optimize Performance**
   - Profile camera switching and capture operations
   - Adjust resolution and frame rate settings
   - Consider caching frames for smoother experience

4. **Complete Documentation**
   - Add detailed API documentation
   - Create user guide for web interface
   - Document hardware setup and requirements
